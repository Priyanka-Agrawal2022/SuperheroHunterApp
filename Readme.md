## [**Live Demo**](https://priyanka-agrawal2022.github.io/SuperheroHunterApp/)
### **Features** 
[**Home Page**](/index.html)
- Fetch and display a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also create a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query. Suppose I type “bat” in the search box, it should show “batman”. 
- Each search result of the superhero should have a favorite button, clicking on which superhero should be added to “Favorites” (a list).
- On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).

[**Superhero  Page**](./superhero.html)
- Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, bio and other information provided by the API (comics, events, series, stories, etc).

[**Favorites  Page**](./favorites.html)
- Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
- Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
- Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
